# Simpsons

### Technology
- [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/docs/) is a really powerful library for sass mixins
- The simpsons are build with pure css

A preview you can see [here](http://codepen.io/Penguinee-1471604509/pen/qqpBoq)

I made a compiled css version or for experimental stuff the sass-version.

Have fun! :)
